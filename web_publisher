                    <br /> Lobbytools creates a direct feed from a Lobbytools folder to your web page. Each folder contains 3 feeds: bills, news articles and important documents. Place these feeds anywhere you want to display this information. For example, put news on your front page, and bills in a members-only, password-protected area. You are already tracking the bills and news articles of interest in your Lobbytools account... so no extra work on your part is necessary! </p>
                <p>Web Publisher is sold separately.&nbsp; For only $100/year you can transform your webpage into a useful communication tool and save yourself time when time matters most – during session. Call (850) 915-0100 and speak to a sales representative today!</p>
